At work I edit a lot of files on a remote development server with TextMate using Cyberduck. &nbsp;When having to edit multiple files in the same directory it can get a bit confusing because using the edit with TextMate feature opens each file in a separate window. &nbsp;To get around this and have TextMate open the files in the project view I did the following.<br />
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have Cyberduck set up to use TextMate.</li>
<br />
<li>In Cyberduck select the file you want to edit and click the edit with TextMate button.</li>
<br />
<li>In the window that opens hit control + shift + o (a terminal will open)</li>
<br />
<li>In the terminal that opens issue the command "mate ."</li>
<br />
<li>Now every file that you open through TextMate will open as a tab in the project view.</li>
</ol>
