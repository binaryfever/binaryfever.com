After meeting up with some old CS classmates at Google IO a few days ago I decided to try and login to one of the old servers we used for classes way back when. No luck, it seems the Sys. Admin purges accounts after six months of inactivity and I graduated in 2008... so yeah. &nbsp;After I shot him a quick email he was nice enough to create a new account for me. &nbsp;Knowing myself though, I will not use it for six months but then find a use for it on the seventh month. &nbsp;So I decided to write a quick ruby script that I set up with a cron job which will run on another server I have. &nbsp;With the net-ssh gem it was easy.<br />
