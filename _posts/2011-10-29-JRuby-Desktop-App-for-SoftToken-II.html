Lately I have been noticing how many mouse clicks it takes me to achieve certain tasks on the computer.  After I ran into this article from the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/09/29/an-introduction-to-desktop-apps-with-ruby/">RubyLearning Blog</a> I decided to attempt to lessen the number of clicks for these tasks.  One of the applications I use quite often is SoftToken II when VPN&#39;ing into work from home/coffee shop/etc...  Thought it might be useful to create an tray application that would allow me easy access to SoftToken.  Enough jibber jabber I&#39;ll just get right into the code.<br>
<strong><em>soft_token.rb</em></strong>
<br>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">class SoftToken
  include Java

  def self.start(command = &quot;./soft_token&quot;, working_directory =   &#39;/Applications/SofToken II.app/Contents/MacOS&#39;)
  cmd = String.new(command)
  work_dir = java::io::File.new(working_directory)

  begin
    r = java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd, nil, work_dir)
    rescue Exception =&gt; e
      $stderr.print &quot;Java told me: #{e}&quot;
    end
  end
end</pre>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What it does:</strong></span>  The SoftToken class takes the command and working directory of the application you want to run.  I use the Java Runtime class exec command to actually start up the application.  You you might also notice the ruby exception handeling with begin and rescue. I found this article to be quite helpful in understanding the differences between JRuby and Java exceptions <a href="http://lorenzod8n.wordpress.com/2007/05/24/dealing-with-java-exceptions-in-jruby/">Dealing with Java exceptions in JRuby</a> .  If an exception does occur it is just being printed to stderr.  One thing to notice also is that I simlinked soft_token to the SoftToken II executable.<br>
