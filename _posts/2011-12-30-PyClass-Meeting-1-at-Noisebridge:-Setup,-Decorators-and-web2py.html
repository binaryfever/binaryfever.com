The free Python class (PyClass) at <a href="https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge" target="_blank">Noisebridge</a> has rebooted and is being taught by Elizabeth Leddy (@eleddy) and Daniel Nowak (@kellankade), who are awesome.  For once I have time in the evening to show up!!!  I&#39;m really stoked about this as I have been wanting to learn python for awhile but just never got around to it.  I plan on making this the first in a series of (weekly-ish) posts where I record the items we discussed.   Getting to it,  this week we covered basic setup, simple hello world, operators, decorators and the web2py framework.<br>

I wont go into setting up Python on OS X because it is pretty straight foward.  One thing to note though is that, although python is already installed, it was suggested that we install a custom version from <a href="http://python.org/">python.org</a>.  Apparently, as with most of the preinstalled Apple items, much of the functionality was ripped out or tweaked.<br>
